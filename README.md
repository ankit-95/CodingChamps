Repository to push Daily Problems that I solve to Practice DSA

Here you folks might get different problems that I will push day-today to make me comfortable with DSA and algorithms that will help me to crack Product based companies interviews.

Firstly I will be solving Recursion Problems.

Now, I have started solving GeeksforGeeks Popular Problems related to a Course Named "Essential Maths for Competitive Programming Java".

Recently added LinkedList, Stack and Trees problems as well.
