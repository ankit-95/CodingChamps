# CodingChamps
Repository to push Daily Problems that I solve to Practice DSA

Here you folks might get different problems that I will push day-today to make me comfortable with DSA and algorithms that will help me to crack Product based companies interviews.

Firstly I will be solving Recursion Problems.

Now, I have started solving GeeksforGeeks Popular Problems related to a Course Named "Essential Maths for Competitive Programming Java".

Recently added LinkedList, Stack, Trees, Sorting and searching problems as well. 

The Idea is to push the problems that in turn will nurish the DSA concepts.

Note : Feel free to recommend changes.
